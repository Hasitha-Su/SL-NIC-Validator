# SL-NIC-Validator

Yesterday we have introduce free public api to get sri lanka's regional information. you can check it out in our group.
Now we have added another service. that will check the validity of sri lankan nic number and will give result whether it is valid or not. if it is valid it will return valid status, dob and sex. otherwise it will show invalid status in json data. it will help you if you build an application that requires nic number. try to enter any wrong nic number. if it is not show invalid status. please let me know. 
GET URI: https://api.mrberry.tech/v1/nic/{nicNo}
eg: https://api.mrberry.tech/v1/nic/972359832v
eg: https://api.mrberry.tech/v1/nic/200023508734
eg: https://api.mrberry.tech/v1/nic/200567509021
We will keep improve our public api as much as we can. Thank you
